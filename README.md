# Hashing 🔑
This repository implements two hashing techniques used to handle collisions in hash tables: Double Hashing and Separate Chaining.
## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Java
- Eclipse IDE
## 🛠️ Features
- **Double Hashing:** A collision resolution technique that uses a second hash function to reduce clustering.
- **Separate Chaining:** Another collision resolution technique that stores multiple elements in the same hash slot using a linked list.
